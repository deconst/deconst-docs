Writing Documentation for Deconst
=================================

If you want to manage or produce content that's published as part of a deconst site, you've come to the right place! Deconst divides site contribution into two distinct roles.

 * **Authors** create content for a part of the site by writing markup.
 * **Coordinators** assemble content from many sources into a single site. Coordinators also control the look and feel of each domain within the site.
