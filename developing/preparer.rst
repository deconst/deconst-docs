Writing a Preparer
==================

If you want to include content from a new :term:`content repository` format,
you'll need to create a new :term:`preparer`. Generally, a preparer needs to:

#. Parse the markup language, configuration files, and other metadata
   for some content format. When possible, you should use the format's
   native libraries and tooling to do so.

#. Parse the ``_deconst.json`` file. Consult the :ref:`new content
   repository section <adding-new-content-repository>` for its schema.

#. Copy assets (usually images) to the directory specified by the
   environment variable ``ASSET_DIR``. It's best to preserve as much
   of the local directory structure as possible from the source
   repository, unless two assets in different subdirectories have the
   same filename.

#. Use the markup to produce rendered HTML. The preparer should use a
   single-character placeholder for each asset URL. As it does so, it
   should generate a map that associates the path of each asset
   relative to ``ASSET_DIR`` to a collection of character offsets
   within the body text at which that asset is referenced.

   As a rule, the rendered HTML *should omit any layouts* from the content
   repository itself and only render the page content, unadorned. In Deconst,
   templates will be applied :ref:`later, from the control repository
   <control-template>`. This is important to ensure a consistent look and feel
   across many content repositories published to the same site, as well as
   allowing users to take advantage of presenter-implemented features like
   :ref:`search <control-search>`.

#. Assemble the content into one or more :term:`metadata envelopes` that match
   the :ref:`envelope schema <envelope-schema>`. If any assets were referenced,
   include the asset offset map as the ``asset_offsets`` element. Write each
   completed envelope to the directory specified by the environment variable
   ``ENVELOPE_DIR`` as a file with the filename pattern ``<content ID,
   URL-encoded>.json``.

Docker Container Protocol
-------------------------

If you run your preparer in an independent environment (like a non-Deconst
continuous integration server), anything that implements the process above will
work fine. If you want your preparer to work within the Deconst client or to be
available to :ref:`automatically created Strider builds
<adding-new-content-repository>`, you need to package your preparer in a Docker
container image that obeys the container protocol described here.

Deconst preparer containers should respect the following configuration values:

* ``ASSET_DIR``: The preparer must copy assets to this directory tree.

* ``ENVELOPE_DIR``: The preparer must write completed envelopes to this
  directory.

* ``CONTENT_ID_BASE``: *(optional)* If set, this should *override* the
  content ID base specified in ``_deconst.json`` for this preparation
  run, preferably with some kind of message if they differ.

* ``CONTENT_ROOT``: *(optional)* If specified, the preparer should prepare
  content mounted to a volume at this path within the container. Otherwise, it
  should default to preparing ``/usr/content-repo``.

When run with no arguments, the preparer container should prepare the
content as described above, then exit with an exit status of 0 if
preparation was successful, or nonzero if it was not.
