Terminology
===========

It's important to have a shared vocabulary when talking about complicated
software systems. We generally try to consistently use these terms in our code,
comments, issues and chat.

.. glossary::

  content repository
  content repositories
     Location containing material to be included as a subset of the completed
     site. Often, the material within will be written in a friendlier
     human-editable markup format such as reStructuredText or Markdown.

     Initially, we will support support content stored in git repositories on
     `GitHub <github.com>`_, although our architecture will be flexible enough
     to integrate content stored anywhere on a network reachable from the build
     system.

  control repository
     Version controlled repository used to organize and administer a deconst
     platform. It contains:

     * Plain-text documents that associate subtrees of indexed content,
       identified by a :term:`content ID` prefix, with subtrees of
       :term:`presented URLs` on the presented site.

     * Layout templates in `handlebars <http://handlebarsjs.com/>`_ format.

     * Plain-text documents that associate subsets of :term:`presented URLs`
       with specific layouts.

   content ID
   content IDs
     Unique identifier assigned to a single page of content generated from a
     :term:`content repository`. It's important to note that a content ID is
     assigned to each *output* page, not each source document. Depending on the
     :term:`preparer` and its configuration, these may differ. Most of the
     architecture should treat these as opaque strings, although the content map
     may need to assume that they are hierarchal.

     By convention, these are URLs that join the base URL of the :term:`content
     repository` with the relative path of the rendered output page.

     When making calls to the content API, the content ID must be URL encoded.
     For example,
     ``https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Frackerlabs%2Fdocs-container-service`` is the
     encoded form of the content ID
     ``github.com/rackerlabs/docs-container-service``.

     Examples:

     * The version of this page on the default "master" branch:
       ``https://github.com/deconst/deconst-docs/running/architecture``.

     * A specific post in a Jekyll blog, generated from (theoretical) content at
       ``https://github.com/rackerlabs/developer-blog/_posts/mongodb-3.0-getting-started.md``:
       ``https://github.com/rackerlabs/developer-blog/blog/mongodb-3.0-getting-started``.

   revision ID
   revision IDs
     Identifier used to isolate different staging environments from one another.

   presented URL
   presented URLs
     URL of a page within the final presented content of a deconst site. This
     should be the full URL, including the scheme and domain.

     Example:
     ``https://developer.rackspace.com/sdks/cloud-servers/getting-started/``.

   template
     Common markup that surrounds each presented page with navigation, brand
     identity, copyright information and anything else that's shared among some
     subset of each site.

   metadata envelope
   metadata envelopes
     JSON document that contains a single page's worth of content as a rendered
     HTML fragment, along with any additional information necessary for the
     presentation of that page. See :ref:`the schema section <envelope-schema>`
     for a description of the expected structure.
