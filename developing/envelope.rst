Metadata Envelope Schema
========================

Much of the deconst system involves the manipulation of
:term:`metadata envelopes`, the JSON documents produced by each
:term:`preparer` that contain the actual content to render. To be
presented properly, envelopes must adhere to a common schema.

This is an example envelope that demonstrates the full document
structure, including all optional fields:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "body": "<h1>Rendered HTML</h1>",
    "title": "SDKs &amp; Tools",
    "author": "Ash Wilson",
    "bio": "He's just this guy, you know?",
    "toc": "<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#\">Top</a></li><li><a href=\"#section\">Section</a></li></ul>",
    "publish_date": "Fri, 15 May 2015 18:32:45 GMT",
    "tags": ["tag one", "tag two"],
    "categories": ["category one", "category two"],
    "keywords": ["keyword one", "keyword two"],
    "unsearchable": true,
    "disqus": {
      "include": true,
      "short_name": "devblog",
      "embed": true
    },
    "next": {
      "title": "The next article",
      "url": "/blog/next-article"
    },
    "previous": {
      "title": "The previous article",
      "url": "/blog/previous-article"
    },
    "addenda": {
      "arbitrary_name": "content-id",
      "repository_toc": "https://github.com/deconst/deconst-docs/_toc"
    },
    "asset_offsets": {
      "local/path/image.jpg": [23, 1456],
      "other/asset.gif": [451]
    }
  }

.. glossary::

  body
    The only required field for a valid envelope. It contains the pre-rendered
    HTML of the page.

  title
    The page title or blog post name used for this document.

  toc
    The table of contents for this page as a fragment of rendered HTML.

  content_type
    If specified, set the Content-Type of the response containing this document.
    Defaults to text/html; charset=utf-8.

  author
    Name of the author who wrote this content.

  bio
    A brief paragraph describing the :term:`author`.

  publish_date
    Approximate timestamp on which this piece of content was published,
    formatted as an RFC2822 string.

  tags
    An array of content classification strings that may be normalized or
    supplemented with machine-generated information.

  categories
    An array of content classification strings that are explicitly user-provided
    and chosen from a list fixed in the control repository.

  keywords
    An array of terms to supplement full-text search indexing.

  unsearchable
    If present and set to ``true``, this envelope will be excluded from the
    full-text search index. Use this for content that hasn't been :ref:`mapped
    <control-map>` yet or documents like RSS feeds, ``robots.txt`` files, and
    other site metadata.

  disqus
    An object that controls the inclusion of Disqus comments on the current
    page. If present, must be an object with the following structure:

    .. code-block:: json

      "disqus": {
        "include": true,
        "short_name": "devblog",
        "embed": true
      }

    **include** toggles the inclusion of any Disqus content at all.
    **short_name** is used to link to a specific Disqus account. **embed**
    toggles the included script between an *embedding script* that injects a
    Disqus comment form on this page and a *count script* that decorates links
    with a comment count.

  next
  previous
    These objects, if included, provide navigational links to adjacent documents
    in a sequence. If present, must be an object with the following structure:

    .. code-block:: json

      "next": {
        "title": "page title",
        "url": "../next-page"
      }

    If the ``url`` key is absolute (rooted at the document root, like
    ``/blog/other-post``), the presenter will re-root it based on the current
    mapping of the content repository. If it's relative, it will be left as-is.

  addenda
    Cross-references to related documents that should be fetched along with this
    envelope to be made available to the template. Each document's envelope is
    available as ``deconst.addenda.<name>.envelope``. Most likely, the attribute
    you want is ``deconst.addenda.<name>.envelope.body``.

  asset_offsets
    This key must only be present in the intermediate representation used to
    communicate between a preparer and the submitter. Its keys are local paths
    to asset files relative to the asset directory. Each value is an array of
    character offsets into ``body`` that should be replaced by the full, public
    URL of the asset.

The documents retrieved from the content store consist of the
requested envelope and a number of additional attributes that are
derived and injected at retrieval time. The full content document
looks like this:

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "envelope": {},
    "assets": {
      "page_css_url": "https://...",
      "page_js_url": "https://..."
    },
    "has_next_or_previous": true,
    "presented_url": "https://...",
    "results": {
      "queryname": []
    }
  }
