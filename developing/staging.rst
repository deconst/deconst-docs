Staging Environment
===================

The staging environment is a specially configured :term:`content service` and
:term:`presenter` pair that allow users to preview content, in context with the
rest of the hosted site, before it's live and shown to end users.

A specific build of previewed content is identified by a :term:`revision ID`.
This gives each build a unique environment and enables the staging environment
to host many revisions independently of one another.

Submitting Content to the Staging Environment
---------------------------------------------

To submit content to the staging :term:`content service`, run the normal
:term:`preparer`, but:

#. Set ``CONTENT_SERVICE_URL`` to the staging environment's API endpoint.

#. Prepend a revision ID as the first URL path segment of your
   :term:`content ID` base. For example, if your content repository's
   normal content ID base is
   ``https://github.com/deconst/deconst-docs/``, set
   ``CONTENT_ID_BASE`` to
   ``https://github.com/build-abcdef/deconst/deconst-docs/`` instead.

The revision ID is arbitrary, but it should be chosen to be relatively
unique among everyone who's staging changes so you don't overwrite one
another's staged content by mistake. Good examples include something
containing part of your current git SHA, your username, or a timestamp
of some kind.

To amend an existing revision's content, re-run the preparer with the
same revision ID. To append content from a different content
repository to the same staging environment, run its preparer with the
revision ID.

Viewing Staged Content
----------------------

To see the content that you've just staged, visit the staging
:term:`presenter`'s address and prepend your revision ID to the URL
path. For example, if you just built content that's normally mapped to
the path ``/docs/`` to a staging server that's available at
``https://staging.example.com/`` with the revision id
``user-smashwilson``, your staged content will be visible at
``https://staging.example.com/user-smashwilson/docs/``.

The rest of the site will be *also* be visible beneath the parent
``/user-smashwilson/`` path exactly as it appears on the current
production site. Any links on any rendered page will be manipulated
such that they will point to the equivalent content within the same
revision ID. This means that you can click around the staging
environment, using site navigation normally, without accidentally
jumping to the production endpoint instead.
